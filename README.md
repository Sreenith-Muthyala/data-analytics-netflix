# data-analytics-netflix
Data Visualization and Analytics of 8700+ data from NETFLIX using Python and PowerBI to explore the trends in the data globally.

# Tools used in this process.
- Python (Colab, Pandas)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (pyhton libraries)
- Power BI (interactive dashboard)
- Data Cleaning, Feature Extraction
- Exploratory Data Analysis

# ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Netflix has more movies than TV shows
- Dramas, Comedies, and Action are dominant genres
- USA and India produce the most content
- Spikes in content release during holiday seasons

## ðŸ“š Summary
Built this project to improve Analytic and visualization skills with data and explore content strategy on Netflix using open datasets and BI tools. Divided my work into Three tasks
1) DATA LOADING AND CLEANING: In this task, I have downloaded the dataset from the open sources like kaggle which contains 8700+ data from the netflix. I used colab for cleaning the data, where i have implemented several pandas functions for filling the missing values, dropping some of the rows with missing data. I have also used some of the python objects to format the data required. Extracted the required data like Year and Month from the date, which would make our analysis more strong.
2) Visual Analysis of Data: Imported Matplotlib and searborn libraries for visualization. I have used several functions from matplotlib and seaborn for displaying the visualization.
3) Preparing Dashboards in PowerBI: After cleaning and visualization of data, I have the uploaded the new dataset to the powerBI, where we can use different visualization types like bar chart, line chart, treemap, cards for analysis of data. Dashboards indicates all the key insights in one place. PowerBI is a powerful tool for making interactive dashboards.
